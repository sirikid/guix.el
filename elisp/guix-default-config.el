;;; Commentary:

;; This file is a "companion" of "guix-build-config.el".  It is used
;; when Emacs-Guix wasn't build with .configure/make, and provides some
;; sensible defaults for the according `guix-config-...' variables.  See
;; also "guix-config.el".

;;; Code:

(defconst guix-config-name "Emacs-Guix"
  "Emacs-Guix full name.")

(declare-function lm-header "lisp-mnt" (header))

(defconst guix-config-version
  ;; Find version in "guix.el".
  (let ((guix.el (expand-file-name "guix.el"
                                   (file-name-directory load-file-name))))
    (or (and (file-exists-p guix.el)
             (require 'lisp-mnt nil t)
             (with-temp-buffer
               (insert-file-contents-literally guix.el)
               (lm-header "version")))
        "<unknown version>"))
  "Emacs-Guix version.")

(defconst guix-config-image-directory nil
  "Directory with image files for Emacs-Guix.")

(defconst guix-config-scheme-directory nil
  "Directory with Scheme files for Emacs-Guix.")
